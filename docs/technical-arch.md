This is a raw set of notes on some implementation ideas on how the architecture can work. In this section, we'll discuss some of the key components and some considerations we should make. Thereâ€™s also some tools that could be a good starting point but assume all of this is subject to change.

### High level overview of how the server looks

### **Server Implementation**

The framework will support both Python and JavaScript server implementations:

- FastAPI for Python
- Fastify for JavaScript/TypeScript

These server implementations are known for their high performance and ease of use, making them ideal choices for building dynamic applications.

### **Database Integration**

The Dynamic Framework will come with built-in support for various databases, such as:

- Redis / PostgreSQL for traditional data storage
- Pinecone / Chroma / Weaviate for vector databases

  This diverse set of databases allows developers to choose the most suitable storage solution for their dynamic applications, enabling seamless integration with various data types and structures.

### **Protocols**

The framework will support multiple communication protocols, ensuring maximum compatibility and flexibility:

- Server Protocols: HTTP, GraphQL, GraphQL Subscriptions, Websockets
- Cron Protocols: Run on timer or interval
- Agent Protocols: Trigger based on agent
- Always-on Protocols: Constantly active, useful for monitoring or background tasks

These protocols cater to a wide range of use cases, from web-based applications and APIs to background processes and agent-triggered actions.

### **Routing**

Dynamic Framework will offer two types of routing:

1. **Static Routing**: Traditional URL-based routes, supporting common formats.
2. **Dynamic Routing**: LLM/agent-based routing without predefined routes. This enables prompt-driven routing and selection based on user requests and contexts.

Dynamic routing unleashes the full potential of LLMs, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware applications.

### **Chain / Agent**

Replacing traditional handlers, Dynamic Framework uses chains and agents:

- Chains can be single-shot or live (with sleep capabilities for live ones)
- Langchain serves as the starting point for chains

This approach provides greater flexibility in application logic, enabling more complex and responsive behaviors.

### **Responses**

The framework will support various response formats:

- React SSR (streaming support in the future)
- HTML
- Text
- AudioText

Responses can be generated by chains or agents themselves, understanding user requests and contexts. This allows for dynamic and context-aware response generation, resulting in more intuitive and interactive applications.

By building on this technical architecture, the Dynamic Framework enables developers to create a new generation of dynamic applications that leverage the power of LLMs, delivering more engaging and context-aware user experiences.
