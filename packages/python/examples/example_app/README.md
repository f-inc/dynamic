# Example App

This is a simple example dynamic app using file-based routing. At the moment, file-based routing supports `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE` requests.

To start, run:

`python app.py`

```python app.py
# app.py
from dynamic import start_server

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()
```
